# Tessera

Tessera is The Exocortex of 2130, where digital humans live.

This project is built around **Phext**, a text-inspired format for configuring and
evolving digital life. The repository includes several example `.phext` files such as
`choose-your-own-adventure.phext`, which demonstrates how to think non-linearly.

## Roadmap

* Windows 10 Upgrade Kit
* Pre-Packaged Woot Node
* Charting Our Kardashev 2.0 Path (20% Annual Growth)
