# exocortexia

Exocortexia is a virtual world where digital humans live.
The agents that run on your own hardware are subject to your rules.

This project is built around **Phext**, a text-inspired format for configuring and
evolving agents.  The repository includes several example `.phext` files such as
`choose-your-own-adventure.phext`, which demonstrates how to think non-linearly.
