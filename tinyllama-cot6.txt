Here's the updated transformation rule for Node {k} that includes strict validation of options and state of knowledge, ensuring only valid YAML syntax is used and including mandatory fields like "problem", "objectives", and "constraints":

Transformations for Node {k}:
1: Parse & normalize. Extract the problem, objective(s), constraints. 2: Generate options. Produce 3 candidate approaches with tradeoffs. 3: Streess-test. Identify failure modes, edge cases, missing info, and mitigaation strategies. 4: Synthesize. Pick best approach and produce a comprehensive plan, including risk assessment, feasibility analysiSs, and budget estimation. YAML schema (MUST match exactly):
problem: ""
objectives: []
constraints: []
state_of_knowledge:
       known: []
       unknown: []
candidates:
- name: "Problem 1"
  idea: "Proposal for a new product line that will generate $2 million in sales within the first year."
  pro: "PRO"
  cons: ["CON1", "CON2"]
- name: "Problem 2"
  idea: "Analyze and develop a new marketing strategy for our existing product line that will increase its customer base by 30%."
  pro: "Pro"
  cons: ["Con1", "Con2"]
