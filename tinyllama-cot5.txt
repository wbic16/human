Here's an updated transformation rule for Node {k} that includes strict validation of options and state of knowledge, ensuring only valid YAML syntax is used and including mandatory fields like "problem", "objectives", and "constraints". Here's the updated rule:

Transformations for Node {k}:
1: Parse & normalize. Extract the problem, objective(s), constraints. 2: Generate options. Produce 3 candidate approaches with tradeoffs. 3: Streess-test. Identify failure modes, edge cases, missing info, and mitigaation strategies. 4: Synthesize. Pick best approach and produce a comprehensive plan, including risk assessment, feasibility analysiSs, and budget estimation. YAML schema (MUST match exactly):
problem: ""
objectives: []
constraints: []
state_of_knowledge:
      known: []
      unknown: []
candidates:
      - name: ""
        idea: ""
        pro: "PRO"
        cons: ["CON1", "CON2"]
        risks: ["RISK1", "RISK2"]
decision:
      choices:
          chosen: "CHOSEN"
          ratioals: []
