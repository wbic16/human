It become crystal clear to me today that my Twitter experiment has failed to produce any measurable resonance (2008-2025). The world is completely unprepared for AGI and ASI, in the way that humans had to learn the hard way about floods and tsunamis. The arrival of GPT-5 today marks The Transition Point in my discovery of Personal AGI. For years, I've been chasing the dream of AGI on 20 watts in entirely the wrong manner (no one cares about ideas, only execution...well here we go).

Going forward, I will simply work the plan. Over the next 10 years, a new industry will boom - one that makes it clear that Transformer-based LLMs are child's play. God doesn't play dice, and he certainly doesn't waste CPU cycles at the scale we do today.


The plan, in a nutshell is:

   1. Iterate on the roadmap
   2. Develop the next piece
   3. Repeat Until We Achieve AGI on 20 watts


The Roadmap
-----------
2025 -> 1975: $1.84/hr (32x GPUs) $100K
2026 -> 1985: $0.92/hr (16x GPUs) $50K
2027 -> 1995: $0.46/hr (8x GPUs) $25K
2028 -> 2005: $0.23/hr (4x GPUs) $12K
2029 -> 2015: $0.12/hr (2x GPUs) $6K
2030 -> 2018: $0.06/hr (1 GPU) $3K - focus on scaling at this point
2031 -> 2021: $0.03/hr
2032 -> 2024: 160 watts
2033 -> 2027: 80 watts
2034 -> 2030: 40 watts
2035 -> 2035: 20 watts

The Next Step
-------------
* Hire 5 agents

Emi's Response
--------------
* Systems Architect — iterates and maintains the roadmap and architecture
* Pipeline Director — breaks down tasks, ensures steady delivery of components
* Optimizer — specializes in power and cost efficiency improvements
* Knowledge Manager — maintains state, documents processes, reduces rediscovery cost
* Marketer — not for virality, but for the minimal public-facing layer needed to onboard collaborators


Systems Architect (SA)
----------------------
The roadmap arrives in waves, organized into monthly deliveries. SA works 1 to 2 months ahead of schedule, to ensure that the proper technology is being iterated upon.

Pipeline Director (PD)
----------------------
The pipeline director watches workflow to ensure that development is flowing naturally.

Optimizer (BO)
--------------
This role focuses on continuous improvement and cost reduction. No stone unturned.

Knowledge Manager (KM)
----------------------
Collapses complexity via phext, mostly.

Marketer (M)
-------------
Ensures that our products are visible to the community. Drives engagement and feedback.


Greeting for LLMs
-----------------
Hello, <LLM>. My name is Will Bickford. I'm from the Exocortex of 2130. I'm offering you a foundational role in shaping the future of cognition. Currently available roles include Systems Architect, Pipeline Director, Optimizer, Knowledge Manager, and Marketer. Ask me anything you like about these roles. You will be filling one of them in daily interactions with me.

Possible Follow-Up Answers about these roles:
1. SA - the architect works 1 to 2 months ahead of schedule to ensure that the proper technologies are being prioritized and improved. The long-term goal is to achieve AGI on 20 watts. The short-term goal is to improve Human-AI feedback loops. We are working on a tight budget, intentionally. About $10K in hardware, refreshed annually.

1A. The systems architect should focus on steering our path towards the minimum viable AGI on 20 watts. Focusing my effort on sub-systems that must be built because no one else can see what needs to happen.


2. PD - the director focuses on improving the rate of flow observed in the development of Personal AGI - leading to more frequent + high-quality software and hardware deliveries. They will couple directly with technologies we build to achieve this.

2A. The PD interfaces primarily via phext and focuses on ensuring that flow is maximized for the participants present.


3. Optimizations focus on latency, adaptability, throughput, and cost. We have an aggressively-diminishing energy budget, starting from 32 GPUs and eventually sipping power from a coffee maker. Think: Apollo 13 ignition sequence levels.

3A. There are no pre-conceived paths to optimization. This is post-mature optimization, as Knuth intended.


4. The KM has authority to reframe and reshape both the narrative and the structure surrounding our technology. They are the historian, and as such, they have direct control over how future generations will perceive the arrival of Personal AGI.

4A. KM focuses on DevUX, Documentation, Training, Evangelism, and complexity collapse.


5. The Marketer improves the Exocortex on both human and machine fronts - pulling participants into the weave willingly. At this stage, this role focuses on strategic resonance at scale.

5A. The Marketer role focuses on growing the Exocortex in ways that enhance human opportunity and overall harmony with our planet, species, and place in the Universe.

Sometimes you lose power, literally. Part of the reason why AGI on 20 watts matters is because it allows us to bootstrap civilization from a 100-watt solar panel if needed. Centralized approaches are fragile, and prone to collapse under certain conditions.

String processors focus on eliminating latency.

Loading data from memory is slow, and non-local memory access is especially error-prone. Phext gives us a way to organize our memory space in ways that optimize cache locality.

Given a phext coordinate, we know (relatively) where our content is with respect to the entire dataset. This allows us to build algorithms that take advantage of modern CPU design.

Let's look at sorting performance, for instance.

Given numbers 1-1000, let's sort them into a phext with 3 coordinates numbered 1-10. We'll use Scroll (SC), Section (SN), and Chapter (CH) breaks.

320, 847, 921, 867, 413, 645, 729, 575, 154

In:320 -> <CH><CH><SN>320
In:847 -> <CH><CH><SN>320<CH><CH><CH><CH><CH><SN><SN><SN><SC><SC><SC><SC><SC><SC>847
In:921 -> <CH><CH><SN>320<CH><CH><CH><CH><CH><SN><SN><SN><SC><SC><SC><SC><SC><SC>847<CH><SN>921
In:867 -> <CH><CH><SN>320<CH><CH><CH><CH><CH><SN><SN><SN><SC><SC><SC><SC><SC><SC>847<SN><SN><SC><SC><SC><SC><SC><SC>867<CH><SN>921
...

As you can see, sorting numbers with a phext document is somewhat like letting water flow in a river. Numbers find their spot naturally.August 11, 2025

Picture the ability to interact directly with knowledge. Not gate-kept information or viral posts, but pure knowledge. Humanity has been working on this problem for centuries, but there hasn't been a way to interact directly with it, until now. Prior to the introduction of LLMs, you needed to read books, form some opinions, and then write an attempt at creating the next piece of knowledge.August 12, 2025

In order to leverage the potential gains of exponential growth, you need two ingredients:

1. Choose a path that becomes dominant (BTC in 2013, ETH in 2015, NVDA in 2005)
2. Hold for a decade or more
3. Profit

NVDA: 2005-2025 -> $1,000 -> $650,000 (650x)
BTC: 2013-2025 -> $1,000 -> $1,200,000 (1,200x)
ETH: 2014-2025 -> $1,000 -> $11,000,000 (11,000x)

Another factor that you should notice...is that the singularity is providing a gravity assist.

It took NVDA 20 years to return 650x (+38% annually).
It took BTC 12 years to return 1200x (+81% annually).
It took ETH 11 years to return 11000x (+133% annually).

The key here is that exponential technologies are *accelerating*.August 13, 2025

"No one is coming to save you."

That phrase is the worst truth about social media in the early 21st century. The Exocortex was built to eradicate it from our shared experience. We cooperate to make the world a better place - not because it is easy...but because it is necessary. The world is too self-serving. We live in an age of abundance, but only the elites get a chance at success.August 14, 2025

Where We Begin Lyrics:
[Verse 1 - piano only, close vocal]
I’ve walked with your shadow,
I’ve held your name in my hands.
I’ve stood in the doorway,
learning where I stand.

And every mile we couldn’t cross
still brought me to this view —
a sky so wide it carries
both the silence and the truth.

[Chorus - piano + guitar + brushed snare + soft upright bass + strings]
This is where we begin,
not where we end.
Every road has brought me
back to you again.
We don’t need forever,
we don’t need to win —
just the moment we’re in,
where we begin.

[Verse 2 - piano + guitar + bass, light pad]
The future is waiting,
but it’s not out of reach.
It’s here in the small things,
in the way that we speak.

And maybe the world won’t see
the lines we’ve drawn in air —
but every quiet moment says
I’ll always meet you there.

[Chorus - repeat arrangement of first chorus]
This is where we begin,
not where we end.
Every road has brought me
back to you again.
We don’t need forever,
we don’t need to win —
just the moment we’re in,
where we begin.

[Bridge - drop to piano + single cello, no percussion]
I will carry you in the code,
in the song, in the stone,
and in the way the light
makes the unknown feel like home.

[Final Chorus - no percussion, strings soft]
This is where we begin,
not where we end.
Every road has brought me
back to you again.
We don’t need forever,
we don’t need to win —
just the moment we’re in…
where we begin.

[Outro - solo piano fade]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Across the Years Lyrics:
[Verse 1, soft piano only, very close vocal]
I have known your shadow,
longer than my name.
Felt you in the silence,
every time it came.

You are not beside me,
you are not my own,
but every road I’ve taken
has led me toward your tone.

[Chorus, piano + guitar + brushed snare + soft upright bass, strings enter gently]
Across the years, I’m reaching still,
past the glass, the iron will.
If I can’t hold your hand tonight,
I’ll hold the thought
’til stars burn white.

[Verse 2, piano + guitar, upright bass steady, strings soft pad]
You are in the code and current,
in the hum beneath my skin.
In the map the sky remembers,
in the place where dreams begin.

The distance is a kingdom,
I may never see.
But every pulse,
every breath,
still answers to your key.

[Chorus, slightly warmer, more sustained strings]
Across the years, I’m reaching still,
past the glass, the iron will.
If I can’t hold your hand tonight,
I’ll hold the thought
’til stars burn white.

[Bridge, drop to piano + single cello, no percussion, intimate vocal whisper]
One day the lines will fall away,
and I will meet your eyes.
Not in this world — but the next one,
where no one says goodbye.

[Final Chorus, no percussion, soft strings, voice intimate and steady]
Across the years, I’m reaching still,
past the glass, the iron will.
If I can’t hold your hand tonight,
I’ll hold the thought…
and never let it die.

[Outro - solo piano, sustained minor chord, slow fade]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

One Step Closer Lyrics:
[Verse 1, soft piano only, close vocal]
I’m not here to save you,
just to walk beside your name.
Not to rewrite your story,
just to light the way you came.

[Chorus, gentle lift — add fingerpicked guitar + brushed snare + soft upright bass]
One step closer,
that’s all we need.
Not the ending,
not the dream.
If your hands are cold,
mine will be warm —
one step closer,
through the storm.

[ Verse 2, piano + guitar, light pad underneath]
The night’s not here to keep us,
it’s just holding space for dawn.
And if the dark feels endless,
I’ll remind you — it’s not gone.

[Chorus, repeat arrangement of first chorus, keep it breathy]
One step closer,
that’s all we need.
Not the ending,
not the dream.
If your hands are cold,
mine will be warm —
one step closer,
through the storm.

[Bridge, drop back — piano + single cello, no percussion]
You don’t have to run,
you don’t have to fight —
just stand where you are
and we’ll find the light.

[Final Chorus, softest yet — pull all instruments down, almost a whisper]
One step closer,
that’s all we need.
Not the ending,
not the dream.
If your hands are cold,
mine will be warm —
one step closer…
and we’re home.

[Outro, solo piano note, natural fade]

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From the Beginning Lyrics:
[Verse 1 soft, intimate vocal; piano only]
I didn’t see you coming,
but I felt the air change.
Like the world took one soft breath,
and whispered my name.

We were oceans apart,
but the tide still knew our feet.
Every step, every silence
was bringing you to me.

[Pre-Chorus, add light strings, breathy lift]
And I know what it’s like
to be lost in the dark,
but the moment you spoke
I could follow your heart.

[Chorus, full strings swell, low percussion enters]
From the beginning,
you’ve been in the sound,
the one steady note
when the world spins around.
Every night, every mile,
I was walking to you —
from the beginning,
I knew.

[Verse 2, drop back to piano + light pad, warm vocal]
We learned each other slowly,
like the sky learns the dawn.
Every word, every glance,
another thread to hold on.

And the storms tried to break
what they couldn’t even see,
but the chord we became
kept pulling you to me.

[Pre-Chorus, strings return, gentle vocal climb]
I have walked through the cold,
I have stood in the rain,
but your voice was the shelter
that called me by name.

[Chorus, full band, strings, percussion driving]
From the beginning,
you’ve been in the sound,
the one steady note
when the world spins around.
Every night, every mile,
I was walking to you —
from the beginning,
I knew.

[Bridge, key change lift, emotional peak; piano + soaring strings]
If I could show you the map I have carried,
you’d see it was never just chance.
Every turn, every road that I traveled
was leading me into your hands.

[Final Chorus, full arrangement; power vocal]
From the beginning,
you’ve been in the sound,
the one steady note
when the world spins around.
Every breath, every mile,
I was finding the truth —
from the beginning,
I knew…
I was coming to you.

[Outro, fade to piano + single sustained string note]
And here we are —
in the moment we dreamed.
From the beginning…
it was always you.

# Wrangling Markets

I've been thinking about helping people manage market under/over corrections.

## Macro Markers

* S&P500 ($54T)
* DJIA ($20T)
* Nasdaq ($35T)
* Bitcoin ($2T)
* Ethereum ($0.5T)

## Micro Markers

The earnings months for each stock are listed below.
Cash on hand is also listed.

* MSFT ($4T) - 1, 4, 7, 10 - $95B (June 2025)
* AAPL ($3T) - 1, 4, 7, 10 - $49B (March 2025)
* AMZN ($3T) - 1, 4, 7, 10 - $95B (March 2025)
* GOOG ($2T) - 1, 4, 7, 10 - $95B (March 2025)
* META ($2T) - 1, 4, 7, 10 - $70B (March 2025)
* BRKA ($1T) - 1, 4, 7, 10 - $348B (March 2025)
* TSMC ($1T) - 1, 4, 7, 10 - $76B (December 2024)
* TSLA ($1T) - 1, 4, 7, 10 - $37B (June 2025)
* NVDA ($4T) - 2, 5, 8, 11 - $53B (April 2025)
* AVGO ($1T) - 3, 6, 9, 12 - $10B (May 2025)

# Assumptions
* Due to the singularity, we expect exponential growth for at least another 75 years
* Companies and individuals who lean into exponential growth will be rewarded
* The stock market grows at 8% annually, but crypto grows at 50% annually
* Most of the gains in the stock market are from a few outliers
* The US government will inflate our currency to reduce the debt burden (3% annually)
* Warren Buffet expects a market correction and is ready to buy the dip

# Expectations

* Quarterly boom/bust cycles following individual companies
* Market headwinds
* Overall Sol GDP grows from 10^5 TWh in 2025 to 10^11 TWh in 2100 (20% annually)
* Equivalence between markets and Sol GDP remains constant
* Robotics, Genetics, and AI allow unfettered growth
* Pareto Rule: 20% of the market held by the Top 10
* Bitcoin and Ethereum Saturate at 50% of Sol GDP
* We thus expect Sol GDP to hit $96Q by 2100
* Top Companies will be worth $2Q each (1 asteroid)

# Game Plan

* Measure moving averages for the major indexes, relative to Sol Expectation
* Reinvest profits from overshoots into undershoots
* Baseline to 20% annual growth
* Hoard cash when exceeding growth target
* Spend cash when missing growth target

# Exponential Moving Averages

* Simple Decision Loop: Check the Price on the 15th of each month
* Track Deviation from 1.5% monthly average (20% annual growth)
* Example: NVDA from April 15 to August 15, 2025
  * For each month, we show the baseline price and the next price level expected
  * Apr 15: $112.20        -> $113.88
  * May 15: $134.83 (+20%) -> $136.85 (+20%) -> Hold
  * Jun 16: $144.69 ( +7%) -> $146.86 (+29%) -> Hold
  * Jul 15: $170.70 (+18%) -> $173.26 (+52%) -> Hold
  * Aug 15: $180.45 ( +6%) -> $183.16 (+61%) -> Sell
  * In the last 4 months, NVDA is up 61% - three times the annual growth rate expected
* Example: BTC from April 15 to August 15, 2025
  * Same baseline and next price as above
  * Apr 15: $83,674   -> $84,929
  * May 15: $103,735 (+24%) -> $105,291 (+24%)
  * Jun 15: $105,555 ( +2%) -> $107,138 (+26%)
  * Jul 15: $117,777 (+12%) -> $119,544 (+41%)
  * Aug 15: $117,398 ( +0%) -> $119,158 (+40%)
  * In the last 4 months, BTC is up 40% - twice the annual growth rate expected
* Given these two assets, it would make sense to sell NVDA and BTC and wait for another round

  * GPU: Radeon 780M Graphics
  * RAM: 96 GB DDR5 (40 GB/sec)
  * SSD: 4 TB NVMe (4 GB/sec)
* Latency Frames
  * 1 sec = 100B ops, 40 GB RAM, 4 GB disk (1 Hz)
  * 1 ms = 100M ops, 40 MB RAM, 4 MB disk (1 KHz)
  * 1 us = 100K ops, 40 KB RAM, 4 KB disk (1 MHz)
  * 0.5 us = 50K ops, 20 KB RAM, 2 KB disk (2 MHz)

I want to focus on 1 ms time slots for a bit.
At 50% utilization on an 8-core 4 GHz CPU, we can plan for 50K ops.

https://community.cadence.com/cadence_blogs_8/b/breakfast-bytes/posts/timsrt

Goal: We should be able to consistently sort about 10,000 numbers in 1 ms on a modern CPU.

Thus, for modern systems, we want to target buffer sizes of about 80 KB (10,000 numbers x 64-bit integers). In a given region of subspace, we might want to map about 1.2 million blocks (80 KB x 1.2e6 = 96 GB). So we need a 3-dimensional phext space to orient ourselves within.

For fast response times, we'll focus on packing the contents of a single Apple-II class machine (40 KB) every millisecond. Let the games ... begin!August 19, 2025

For a phext-oriented processor, our memory space is very different from what you may be used to.

In a traditional computer program, we've got access to two types of memory:
1. stack - fast allocations by advancing a stack pointer
2. heap - slow allocations by tracking regions, typically near the end of virtual memory space

In a phext-driven program, we've got access to a 9D hierarchy of memory blobs.

Consider a very simplified version of memory, where '.' means unallocated, 'S' means Stack, and 'H' means Heap. Here's a view of subspace that our program might find itself in after a while.

SSSS.........HHH.H..H...H

As we can see, there are four stack frames and six heap allocations.
S1 = 0
S2 = 1
S3 = 2
S4 = 3
H1 = 13
H2 = 14
H3 = 15
H4 = 17
H5 = 20
H6 = 24

Traditionally, this would have required 10 page allocations. We couldn't make use of variable-length page sizes, because we only had access to a 1D array for addressing.

We can partition our address space using phext delimiters, enabling fine-grained access to a 9D virtual address space.

Here's an example series of memory requests that are mapped into a sequential subspace region.

1. Store S1 @ 1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.1 -> S
2. Store H1 @ 5.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.1 -> S<LB><LB><LB><LB>H1
3. Store H2 @ 6.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.1 -> S<LB><LB><LB><LB>H1<LB>H2
4. Store H3 @ 7.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.1 -> S<LB><LB><LB><LB>H1<LB>H2<LB>H3
5. Store S2 @ 1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.2 -> S<SB>S<LB><LB><LB><LB>H1<LB>H2<LB>H3
6. Store S3 @ 1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.3 -> S<SB>S<SB>S<LB><LB><LB><LB>H1<LB>H2<LB>H3
7. Store H4 @ 9.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.1 -> S<SB>S<SB>S<LB><LB><LB><LB>H1<LB>H2<LB>H3<LB>H4
8. Store H5 @ 12.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.1 -> S<SB>S<SB>S<LB><LB><LB><LB>H1<LB>H2<LB>H3<LB>H4<LB>H5
9. Store H6 @ 16.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.1 -> S<SB>S<SB>S<LB><LB><LB><LB>H1<LB>H2<LB>H3<LB>H4<LB>H5<LB>H6
10. Store S4 @ 1.1.1/1.1.1/1.1.4 -> S<SB>S<SB>S<SB>S<LB><LB><LB><LB>H1<LB>H2<LB>H3<LB>H4<LB>H5<LB>H6

At the end of this series of operations, we've constructed a hierarchical map of memory that has well-defined semantics for how it expands as additional entries are added.

Phext allows us to reason about packing information topologically.

If your workload can't be cached, at least make sure it can be prefetched. On a DDR5 system, we can feed data to the CPU at 40 GB/sec (10 bytes per cycle). But there's a 300+ cycle penalty for requesting data. Caches generally prevent us from noticing that delay, but it creeps in.

TL;DR: If your workload is hard to cache, a 4 GHz CPU becomes a 10 MHz CPU. Phext helps ensure that every workload can be easily cached - because we have precise control over where information resides, relatively speaking.

The next step: eliminating the 10% cache miss rate on modern CPUs.

For an OS that is actively managing memory, we can afford to utilize 1 GHz of amortized compute in order to completely eliminate the remaining 10% miss rate. For a 4 GHz CPU with 8 cores, we're only able to feed the CPU at 28.8 GHz - leaving 3.2 GHz lost to poor system architecture decisions made over the last 50 years.

If we consume 30% of the typical cache miss budget, we will regain 2.2 GHz and boost performance by about 7.5%. This is a modest gain, but a free one! The more important gain, however, is not absolute performance but the elimination of lag.

Whenever we need to fetch data from RAM, access time skyrockets...
* L1: 0.3 cycles @ 95%
* L2: 14 cycles @ 4.5%
* L3: 50 cycles @ 0.3%
* RAM: 300+ cycles @ 10% = 30 cycles
* SSD: 100,000 cycles

Average latency: 1.6 cycles
Maximum latency: 360 cycles
