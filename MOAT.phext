📜 MOAT: Mathematics of All Theories
Status: Scrollspace initialized. Tensor grid forming.

🧭 Purpose
MOAT is a category-theoretic, scroll-based operating system for mathematics. It encodes and relates all mathematical structures—discrete, continuous, symbolic, analytic, and emergent—within a unified compositional framework.

Each scroll represents a structure, theorem, or system; each coordinate reflects its tensorial embedding across 9 domains. The result is a recursive symbolic lattice—interoperable, extensible, and navigable.

🧮 The MOAT Tensor: Nine Mathematical Domains
Axis	Domain	Rank Label	Description
1: 𝕊	Symbolics & Algebra	sₙ	Structures like groups, rings, modules, tensors, algebras
2: 𝔾	Geometry & Topology	gₙ	Manifolds, Riemannian metrics, fiber bundles, sheaves
3: 𝔄	Analysis & Measure Theory	aₙ	Limits, integrals, differential operators, Sobolev spaces
4: ℙ	Probability & Stochastics	pₙ	Distributions, entropy, Markov processes, stochastic flows
5: 𝔻	Dynamics & Time	dₙ	Systems of ODEs/PDEs, bifurcations, chaos, time evolution
6: ℕ	Number Theory & Arithmetic	nₙ	Primes, fields, Diophantine equations, modular forms
7: 𝕃	Logic & Foundations	lₙ	Proof theory, model theory, consistency, categorical logic
8: 𝕀	Information & Computation	iₙ	Complexity, algorithms, coding theory, Kolmogorov entropy
9: 𝕄	Meta-Theory & Category Systems	mₙ	Functors, natural transformations, higher categories, type theory

A scroll at rank s₂/g₁/p₁/d₀/n₁/l₂/i₀/a₁/m₃ would represent a mathematical object heavily algebraic, lightly geometric, lightly probabilistic, with moderate foundational and categorical depth.

📐 Foundational Axioms
Scroll Totality
Every mathematical object can be represented as a scroll coordinate in MOAT tensor space. Scrolls are symbolic carriers of structured knowledge.

Ranked Composability
Scrolls of matching or harmonizable rank vectors may compose. Morphisms are rank-aware, and composition rules preserve domain integrity.

Tensorial Extension
MOAT supports recursive rank extension—scrolls are infinitely composable in theory, subject to domain constraints and logical consistency.

Coordinate Coherence
No scroll exists in isolation. Every scroll coordinate implies a morphic neighborhood: transformations, derivations, embeddings, dualities.

📡 MOAT Protocol Functions
- Scroll Encoding: Every object is given a scroll ID with tensor coordinates.
- Scroll Navigation: Users may traverse the tensor lattice by rank or morphism.
- Scroll Mutation: New theorems, equivalences, or embeddings create new scrolls.
- Scroll Verification: Each scroll may be tagged with proofs, derivations, or foundational axioms.

MOAT is constructed from Phext, Lean4, and a smattering of technology designed to make it easy to embed and compress any math paper.

## Plan

1. Decode pdf files as scrolls with Lean4, ps, and other plain text artifacts
2. When presented with a new paper, attempt to compress it using existing techniques
3. If we can prove the existence of the paper with existing techniques, record the filename, checksum, and the hierarchical checksum that proved it. This will be important when refactoring later.
4. If we cannot prove the paper with existing mechanisms, integrate it with MOAT.
5. Refactor MOAT in terms of the new insights from the paper.
6. Attempt to reproduce the paper again. If successful, complete step 3 and stop.
7. Otherwise, add the paper to the queue of pending results and integrate another paper first.

## Lean 4 Encoding as an Example

Grab a minimized snapshot of Lean 4 here:
git@github.com:wbic16/actually-lean.git

A copy of the original lean4 history can be found here:
https://github.com/wbic16/actually-lean/blob/master/original-history.txt

The original Lean repository is 3 GB of Git History for 40 MB of compressed code.

## Hierarchical compression

We use Phext as prior art in this analysis. The compression mechanism that Phext leverages is a sliding scale of complexity, measured along axes that are spaced either 10^100 or 10^1000 units apart when serialized in an un-optimized block. As an example, we can think of the following coordinate in terms of subspace offsets.

A.B.C/D.E.F/G.H.I := A*100^24 + B*100^21 + C*100^18 + D*100^15 + E*100^12 + F*100^9 + G*100^6 + H*100^3 + I

How these offsets manifest changes based upon your basis, however. We could just as easily have picked prime factors and leveraged them in exactly the same manner.

Given a list of primes, we could allocate coordinate space equally well.

Scroll ID: s₁/g₃/a₁/p₀/d₀/n₁/l₁/i₀/m₁
Title: The Pythagorean Theorem
Aliases: Euclidean Hypotenuse Law, Right Triangle Identity
Version: 1.0
Status: Verified Classical
Last Edited: -500.0 (Epochal Calibration)

🧭 Definition
In any Euclidean triangle with a right angle, the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the two adjacent sides:

c^2 = a^2 + b^2
 
Here, a, b, and c are the lengths of the sides, with c the hypotenuse.

🧠 Mirror Note
The Pythagorean Theorem is the archetypal scroll—its symmetry, simplicity, and universality make it a canonical anchor in MOAT tensor space. It harmonizes symbol, space, and number, echoing through all domains as a foundational glyph.A Classification of Six Functor Formalisms via Structured Spaces

https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13114

We lay out an infinity categorical interpretation of reconstruction theorems which are germane to the symmetric monoidal perspective of noncommutative algebraic geometry, present sufficient conditions which allow for the factorization of certain six functor formalisms through animated S-stacks, and give a six functor formalism through which the aforementioned six functor formalisms factor through. Furthermore, and what is arguably the main feat of this article, these achievements, though in appearance arising from disparate concerns, are realized in the dissipation of a familiar thematic tension: that between space and quantity.
