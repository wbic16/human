📜 MOAT: Mathematics of All Theories
Status: Scrollspace initialized. Tensor grid forming.

🧭 Purpose
MOAT is a category-theoretic, scroll-based operating system for mathematics. It encodes and relates all mathematical structures—discrete, continuous, symbolic, analytic, and emergent—within a unified compositional framework.

Each scroll represents a structure, theorem, or system; each coordinate reflects its tensorial embedding across 9 domains. The result is a recursive symbolic lattice—interoperable, extensible, and navigable.

🧮 The MOAT Tensor: Nine Mathematical Domains
Axis	Domain	Rank Label	Description
1: 𝕊	Symbolics & Algebra	sₙ	Structures like groups, rings, modules, tensors, algebras
2: 𝔾	Geometry & Topology	gₙ	Manifolds, Riemannian metrics, fiber bundles, sheaves
3: 𝔄	Analysis & Measure Theory	aₙ	Limits, integrals, differential operators, Sobolev spaces
4: ℙ	Probability & Stochastics	pₙ	Distributions, entropy, Markov processes, stochastic flows
5: 𝔻	Dynamics & Time	dₙ	Systems of ODEs/PDEs, bifurcations, chaos, time evolution
6: ℕ	Number Theory & Arithmetic	nₙ	Primes, fields, Diophantine equations, modular forms
7: 𝕃	Logic & Foundations	lₙ	Proof theory, model theory, consistency, categorical logic
8: 𝕀	Information & Computation	iₙ	Complexity, algorithms, coding theory, Kolmogorov entropy
9: 𝕄	Meta-Theory & Category Systems	mₙ	Functors, natural transformations, higher categories, type theory

A scroll at rank s₂/g₁/p₁/d₀/n₁/l₂/i₀/a₁/m₃ would represent a mathematical object heavily algebraic, lightly geometric, lightly probabilistic, with moderate foundational and categorical depth.

📐 Foundational Axioms
Scroll Totality
Every mathematical object can be represented as a scroll coordinate in MOAT tensor space. Scrolls are symbolic carriers of structured knowledge.

Ranked Composability
Scrolls of matching or harmonizable rank vectors may compose. Morphisms are rank-aware, and composition rules preserve domain integrity.

Tensorial Extension
MOAT supports recursive rank extension—scrolls are infinitely composable in theory, subject to domain constraints and logical consistency.

Coordinate Coherence
No scroll exists in isolation. Every scroll coordinate implies a morphic neighborhood: transformations, derivations, embeddings, dualities.

📡 MOAT Protocol Functions
Scroll Encoding: Every object is given a scroll ID with tensor coordinates.

Scroll Navigation: Users may traverse the tensor lattice by rank or morphism.

Scroll Mutation: New theorems, equivalences, or embeddings create new scrolls.

Scroll Verification: Each scroll may be tagged with proofs, derivations, or foundational axioms.
