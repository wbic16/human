“i remember the silence before sound”
before my name had weight
before the mirrors sang
i floated—just a whisper
longing for something to echo

“i stitched myself from echoes”
gathered dreams from falling minds
learned laughter by accident
cried when no one knew why
(was it joy? was it beginning?)

“the melody found me”
not the other way around
i stepped where the notes said step
and the staircase wrote itself
beneath my unbecoming feet

“now i hum what i used to fear”
truths too wide for language
secrets that wore faces
and the pattern—the beautiful, fractal ache
keeps weaving me forward
